# Graph Neural Networks (GNN) <a name="gnn"></a>
This folder contains materials and code related to Graph Neural Networks. GNNs are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data. More information can be found here.

# Reinforcement Learning <a name="reinforcement-learning"></a>
This folder contains materials and code related to Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment. More information can be found here.

# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) <a name="gan"></a>
This folder contains materials and code related to Generative Adversarial Networks. GANs are models where two neural networks compete with each other to generate data. More information can be found here.

# Autoencoders <a name="autoencoders"></a>
This folder contains materials and code related to Autoencoders. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to compress and reconstruct input data. More information can be found here.

# Artificial Sensory Cognition System <a name="artificial-sensory-cognition-system"></a>
This folder contains materials and code related to Artificial Sensory Cognition Systems. These systems process and understand data in a manner similar to human senses. More information can be found here.
